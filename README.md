# spooky-jam-2022
Tiny exploratory gamejam at a spooky time of the year. Developed in Unreal Engine 5.0.3.

## Feature set

Small strategy game where you don't control the units, they're instead controlled by an AI running in a remote server.

### MVP
 - Spawn in a 3D world isometric view
 - Camera can be fixed
 - There is a main base which is a single building
 - The user can press a button to generate a warrior or a gatherer
 - Units are AI-(server)-controlled (you don't interact with them, they choose their targets)
 - There is at least one pile of resources (infinite)
 - There will be spots around the base where enemies can spawn
 - Enemies will walk-attack towards the closest main-base until main-base or enemy is defeated

### Improvements
 - Camera movement
 - Have it multiplayer, players spawn next to another and let their units compete
